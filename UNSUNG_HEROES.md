## History & Journalism

- [Gareth Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Jones_(journalist)) was a Welsh journalist who in March 1933 first reported in the Western world, 
without equivocation and under his own name, the existence of the Soviet famine of 1932–33, including the Holodomor. Jones also became one of the first 
foreign journalists to fly with Hitler as he accompanied Hitler and Joseph Goebbels to Frankfurt where he reported for the Western Mail on the new Chancellor's 
tumultuous acclamation in that city. He wrote in the Welsh Western Mail that if the Richthofen had crashed the history of Europe would have changed. 
He died on a "Round-the-World Fact-Finding Tour" in Mongolia where had been captured and murdered by bandits. There was a suspicion that his murder had been 
engineered by the Soviet NKVD, as revenge for the embarrassment he had caused the Soviet regime.
